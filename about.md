# About this project

This is a simple project created by [Gabriel Gomes](https://github.com/gabrielgomeso). A special thanks to [Paul Laros](https://laros.io/), who wrote insightful articles on generating RSS feeds, metatags, and sitemaps in a VitePress project. I added the blog post listing and made a few other configurations, but my goal was to keep this project as clean and straightforward as possible so others can easily customize it to their needs.
If you have any questions I extremely recommend reading Vitepress docs or opening a Q&A discussion at their repository.
